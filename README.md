## 🎯 About Me

I'm a systems thinker passionate about building data infrastructure at scale. My goal is to create production-ready pipelines that power analytics and drive business decisions.

**Background:**
- MSBA student specializing in Data Engineering
- Strong foundation in Python, SQL, and cloud platforms
- Experience with data visualization (Power BI, Tableau)
- Teaching Assistant - helping others learn data concepts

**What drives me:**
I love the challenge of organizing massive amounts of data into clean, reliable systems. The "plumbing" that makes everything else possible.

## 📂 Current Projects

### 🚀 Stock Market Data Pipeline (Active)
**Week 1 - Foundation Phase**

Building a production data pipeline that ingests real-time stock market data.

**Status:**
- ✅ Alpha Vantage API integration complete
- ✅ Successfully fetching live stock data (5-min intervals)
- ✅ API authentication and response handling working
- 🔄 Next: Convert to Python scripts and deploy to AWS Lambda

**What it demonstrates:**
- API integration and data extraction
- Cloud deployment (AWS Lambda, S3)
- Data warehousing (Snowflake)
- Orchestration (Apache Airflow)
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform)

**Tech Stack:**
`Python` `Alpha Vantage API` `AWS Lambda` `S3` `Snowflake` `Airflow` `dbt`

**Files:**
- `api_exploration.ipynb` - Initial API testing and exploration

**Next Steps:**
1. Create production Python scripts
2. Deploy Lambda function to AWS
3. Set up S3 storage buckets
4. Connect to Snowflake warehouse
5. Add Airflow orchestration
6. Implement data quality checks
